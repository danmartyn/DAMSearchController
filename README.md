# DAMSearchController
An alternative to UISearchController for iOS that can be tweaked to work in any app.

After upgrading our app to use the new UISearchController from iOS 8, I found many issues with search in our app. I decided to create my own search controller. It was all ready to go in a base class for tables, when I read this fantastic post by Soroush Khanlou: http://khanlou.com/2016/02/many-controllers/ 

This is an example of using the Many Controllers technique to create a search view controller and a category on UIViewController, to be able to add search to any UIViewController in your app.

Enjoy!
